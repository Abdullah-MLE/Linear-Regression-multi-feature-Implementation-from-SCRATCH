## Project Description

This project implements a linear regression model with multiple input features from scratch using Python and NumPy. It demonstrates the core concepts of linear regression, including data generation, cost function calculation (Mean Squared Error), and optimization using gradient descent. The implementation aims to provide a clear understanding of how these components work together to train a linear model without relying on high-level machine learning libraries for the core algorithm.

**Key Features:**

  * **Synthetic Data Generation:** A `generate_noisy_multi_feature_data` function creates synthetic datasets with a specified number of samples, features, true coefficients, intercept, and noise level. This allows for controlled testing and validation of the linear regression implementation.
  * **Cost Function (Mean Squared Error):** The `f` function calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which serves as the cost function to be minimized during the training process.
  * **Gradient Calculation:** The `f_derivative` function computes the gradient of the MSE with respect to the model's weights (coefficients and intercept). This gradient guides the optimization process in gradient descent.
  * **Gradient Descent Optimization:** The `gradient_descent` function iteratively updates the model's weights by moving in the direction opposite to the gradient, aiming to minimize the cost function. It includes parameters for step size, precision, and maximum iterations.
  * **Comparison with Scikit-learn:** The `main.py` script includes a comparison section where the custom-built linear regression model's results (coefficients, intercept, and MSE) are compared against those obtained from `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`. This serves as a validation of the custom implementation's correctness.

**Files:**

  * `data_generation.py`: Contains the `generate_noisy_multi_feature_data` function for creating synthetic datasets.
  * `cost_function.py`: Defines the cost function (`f`) and its derivative (`f_derivative`).
  * `gradient_descent_mulity_input_variable.py`: Implements the `gradient_descent` algorithm.
  * `main.py`: The main script to run the linear regression, generate data, train the model, and compare it with scikit-learn's implementation.

# Linear Regression Multi-Feature Implementation from Scratch

This project provides a complete implementation of a linear regression model for multiple input features using pure Python and NumPy. The goal is to demystify the internal workings of linear regression, including the cost function (Mean Squared Error) and the optimization algorithm (Gradient Descent), by building them from the ground up.

## Introduction

Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in supervised machine learning used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This project implements a multi-feature linear regression model from scratch, demonstrating the core mathematical concepts and optimization techniques involved.

## Features

  * **Synthetic Data Generation:** Easily create custom datasets with specified true coefficients, intercept, and noise.
  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Cost Function:** Calculates the error between predicted and true values.
  * **Gradient Descent Optimizer:** Iteratively updates model parameters (weights and intercept) to minimize the MSE.
  * **Modular Design:** Separated functions for data generation, cost calculation, and optimization for clarity and reusability.
  * **Scikit-learn Comparison:** Includes code to compare the custom implementation's performance and learned parameters with `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.

  * `data_generation.py`: Contains the `generate_noisy_multi_feature_data` function responsible for creating synthetic datasets for testing the linear regression model.
  * `cost_function.py`: Defines the `f` function (Mean Squared Error) which calculates the cost, and `f_derivative` which computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights.
  * `gradient_descent_mulity_input_variable.py`: Implements the `gradient_descent` algorithm, which is the core optimization routine that updates the model's weights.
  * `main.py`: The entry point of the project. It orchestrates the data generation, training of both the custom linear regression model and a scikit-learn model, and compares their results.

## How It Works

1.  **Data Generation:** The `data_generation.py` script creates a synthetic dataset `X` (features) and `Y_true` (target values) based on a linear relationship with added noise.
2.  **Model Initialization:** Initial weights (coefficients and intercept) are set.
3.  **Cost Function:** The `cost_function.py` calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify the difference between the model's predictions and the true target values. The goal of gradient descent is to minimize this cost.
4.  **Gradient Calculation:** The `cost_function.py` also computes the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each weight. These derivatives form the gradient, indicating the direction of the steepest ascent of the cost function.
5.  **Gradient Descent:** The `gradient_descent_mulity_input_variable.py` iteratively updates the weights. In each iteration, it moves the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient (down the slope of the cost function) by a small `step_size` (learning rate). This process continues until the change in weights falls below a certain `precision` or a `max_iter` limit is reached.
6.  **Prediction:** Once the optimal weights are found, the model can make predictions on new data.
7.  **Comparison:** The `main.py` script compares the learned weights, intercept, and the resulting MSE of the custom model with that of Scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` to validate the implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

  * `numpy`
  * `scikit-learn` (for comparison purposes)
  * `seaborn` (for potential future plotting, though not fully utilized in the current `main.py`)

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn seaborn
```

### Running the Code

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Results and Comparison

The `main.py` script will print the following:

  * The true weights and intercept used for generating the synthetic data.
  * The `model_coef_w`, `model_intercept_w0`, and `model_mse` from the Scikit-learn `LinearRegression` model.
  * The `my_weights` (coefficients), `my_intercept_w0`, and `my_mse` from your custom implementation.

You should observe that the custom implementation's results are very close to (or ideally, match) those of the Scikit-learn model, demonstrating the correctness of the scratch implementation.
